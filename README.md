# Recreation-of-Minesweeper-in-x86-Assembly

A recreation of the game Minesweeper in the linux terminal. Includes source code and a makefile to assembly and compile it with NASM and GCC. You will need the GNU make command as well as the 32 bit library in GCC if you don't have it already

The game uses keyboard instead of mouse and ANSI escape codes implimented in Bash to make it look better
It has a title screen, game, and end screen to replay, quit, or make the game more difficult.
